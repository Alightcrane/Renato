    <p>
        I am a 17 year old brother, son, friend, and future father. I like playing video games, not your usual CoD, I love playing Path of Exile, Maplestory, and Dota 2. Other interesting things I do in my off time include Photoshop because that is the thing I use to troll my friends with their pictures. Another small hobbies I have include solving puzzles such as rubik's cube and sudoku. I also play chess, but I have no one to play with no more because my only opponent I've ever had was my cousin and he is in jail. So I don't play chess anymore.
