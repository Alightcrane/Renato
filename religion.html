        Religion Disintegration
    </h1>
    <p>
        If you are religious, you will hate me after listening to this. Specially if you are Christian or Catholic. My dream is to get rid of all religions. I know this would go against everything everyone believes in specially the US constitution and the line that reads "freedom of religion." But I Strongly believe that religion is toxic to our world. It all has to do with diversity. Yes everyone is, in fact, different but with religion we segregate so much as people. Religion is Segregation. My strongest reason I have towards this is that these religions have only brought death and dispair in people. For example, the KKK is a Christian group that kills every other race besides whites to "restore" America to how it was. Another example is Catholics, the Catholic church use to kill people if they thought they were witches, if they were gay, or if they did not devote their life to god. If religion brings these type of things, why do people still practice them today?
