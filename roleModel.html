    <p>
        Malcolm Gladwell is a journalist and bestselling author. He is the author of many of my favorite books and my all time favorite book "Outliers: The Story of Success".This book has it all, from riveting science to self-help. And all of his books are always based on things that are foreseen by people but no one ever tries to answer. I recommend the book to anyone, but quick disclaimer, you will feel some anger after you're done.
