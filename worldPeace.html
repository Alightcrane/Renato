        Okay this is a dream I should have discarded from my mind long ago. Whenever I tell anyone this, the common answers come up: "that is never going to happen," "f*cking hipster." Yes I do realize this dream is stupid but that does not mean I cannot dream on it. All I really want is for violence to stop and for people to open their eyes to see the value of human lives. If everyone kept this in mind, fighting, killing, and any other type of wrong would be corrected. I am not trying to play God, I am just a guy with a dream of changing the world completely.
