        This is probably the worst time I can be making this. But I just have to express my dreams. The US, along with any other country, has so many restrictions on citizens to keep them safe. I do keep this in mind, but why is the country always stealing from you. Everyone has to open their eyes and see that everything that is being sold in stores are the symbols of the chains that the states hold. The states are constantly stealing from everyone but we are just blinded to this. Also every billboard is the states brainwashing you. Stop giving in. Madly influenced by Rage Against the Machine, aka my favorite band ever. TO be more specific is the song "Bullet in The Head."
